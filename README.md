# codeday
made in 24 hours with ‚ù§Ô∏è and ‚òïÔ∏è at CodeDay Seattle, February 18-19, 2017.

## the idea:
remind your roommate ([project](https://lkhwa.github.io/codeday/), [final presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C5llEMiKUVIlYbYUpYPQElpoDxz9-m6HbX1LnBXi2gw/edit?usp=sharing)) is a web application that simplifies the way you communicate with your roommate on common tasks such as cleaning the bathroom, paying rent, and scheduling events! we chose email as the method of communication: users just need fill them with what they need (how much is due? what's it for?), and we'll (well, emailjs üòâ) will take care of the rest!

## built with:
* html, css, javascript & jquery for the website
* google material design lite for pretty things
* emailjs to make email magic happen
* flaticons for icons, of course
